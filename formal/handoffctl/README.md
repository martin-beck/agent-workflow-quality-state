# handoffctl transition and concurrency contract

This directory defines the machine-checked contract for every task-lifecycle
mutation performed by `tools/handoffctl`. The TLA+ model is an abstraction of
the Python implementation, not a replacement implementation.

## Transition contract

Every accepted lifecycle command increments `task_revision` exactly once, updates the
generated projections under the same exclusive repository lock, validates the
result, creates at most one local state commit, and releases the lock. A rejected
command and any detected pre-commit failure leave the task revision, task state,
owner and generated projections unchanged.

| Command | Required source | Required actor/revision | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `promote` | `planned`, unowned, dependencies done | exact revision | `open` |
| `resume` | `blocked`, unowned | exact revision | `open` |
| `claim` | `open`, dependencies done | actor holds no other task | `in_progress`, actor and lease set |
| `heartbeat` | `in_progress` | current owner, positive lease | lease renewed |
| `update` | `in_progress` | current owner, exact revision | active fields updated |
| `release` | `in_progress` | current owner | chosen non-active state, owner and lease cleared |
| `run` record | `in_progress`, unexpired | current owner, latest locked revision | bounded external result appended as `update` |

`release --status` currently accepts every schema status other than
`in_progress`; therefore the formal model checks releases to `planned`,
`open`, `blocked`, and `done`.

`run` executes the caller's command outside the coordinator lock, with a finite
deadline. Its result record then uses the same locked `update` transition at the
latest revision. The arbitrary external command is outside the TLA+ proof; its
coordinator-state effect is inside it.

The linearization point is the successful transition while the process holds
`.runtime/state.lock`. Expected revisions are checked only after lock
acquisition. Consequently two processes that observed the same revision cannot
both apply revision-guarded changes, and two claimants cannot both claim one
open task.

## Permanent project binding

`HandoffctlBinding.tla` models an initialized coordinator bound to exactly one project. A call
from the bound project is accepted; a call from any other project preserves state. The bound
identity is constant, accepted/rejected classification matches caller identity, and weak fairness
of correct calls establishes that a correctly invoked coordinator can continue to make progress.
The implementation refines this guard by checking the profile UUID, state Git root and origin,
product identity and origin, and caller working directory before normal command execution.

## Checked properties

`Handoffctl.tla` exhaustively enumerates two processes, two tasks, every
coherent initial status/owner combination, ready and blocked dependencies,
every lifecycle command, current and stale revisions, injected pre-commit
rollback, and every process interleaving. `HandoffctlLocks.tla` separately
enumerates three processes as readers and writers, including two simultaneous
readers, a competing writer, and bounded lock-wait timeout. TLC checks:

- exclusive-lock mutual exclusion and a single linearization point;
- coherent ownership and at most one active task per actor;
- no lost or duplicate accepted mutation through exact revision accounting;
- atomic task/projection revision advancement and rollback;
- rejection of invalid source, owner, dependency, and revision combinations;
- timeout without state mutation when another process holds the lock;
- deadlock freedom and eventual completion under weak process/lock fairness.

Two processes are sufficient for pairwise lifecycle races; two tasks cover the
one-active-task-per-actor invariant. The separate three-process lock model
covers two readers plus one writer. The binding model covers the configured project and one foreign
caller, including rejection without mutation and fair progress for correct calls. These are finite
exhaustive proofs of the abstractions, not proofs of Linux, Git, Python, or the filesystem
implementation.

## Refinement obligations and assumptions

The implementation satisfies the model only while all of these obligations
hold:

1. Every cooperating reader and writer uses the same local
   `.runtime/state.lock`; the filesystem implements local POSIX `flock(2)`
   semantics. NFS and non-cooperating direct file/Git writers are outside the
   proof boundary.
2. Task and projection replacement is atomic, validation occurs before commit,
   and detected pre-commit exceptions restore every touched path.
3. Lock acquisition and internal Git/GitHub scans have finite deadlines.
   External scheduling is weakly fair: a continuously runnable waiter
   eventually runs.
4. A process holding the lock eventually exits its critical section. Arbitrary
   `SIGKILL`, kernel failure, storage loss, and power loss during a multi-file
   transaction require reconciliation and are not claimed as atomic.
5. A failed push after a successful local commit does not roll back that durable
   commit; replication is retried by reconciliation.

The focused implementation tests exercise the real `flock`, atomic replacement,
rollback, concurrent mutation/reconciliation, revision fencing, ownership and
generated-view behavior. The model and tests must both pass before a
`handoffctl` change is accepted.

## CI scope

`.github/workflows/handoffctl-formal.yml` is path-filtered to the handoffctl
implementation, its focused test, this model, and the workflow itself. Ordinary
high-frequency coordinator-state commits do not start this gate.

## Run locally

```bash
formal/handoffctl/verify.sh
uv run python -m unittest tests.test_handoffctl
```

`verify.sh` downloads the official TLA+ 1.7.4 verifier into a temporary
directory and verifies its pinned SHA-256 before execution. It does not retain
the JAR or modify coordinator state.
